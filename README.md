Creating a game for Summer Open 2025 Hackathon

Our Focus:
We have decided to create a game called **Twisted Wizards**, which is a fighter (street fighter-esque) game, where a wizard (the good user aka you) fights a twisted, shadow wizard (the bad bot) - although this game was short, it is a repeatable fighting game where the user can redo their gameplay as many times as they want to practice against the enemy. It has (maybe) nice music, a cool theme and design, and multiple (just 2), attacks to test - plus basic movement controls. 

Synopsis of requirements:
Background
You're the creative lead at an indie game studio who just created their first hit game and funding for the next one has just come through. You can build any type of game you want. No genre restrictions. No theme limitations. Just one rule: it must be something that you would play yourself!
Whether it's a fast-paced action platformer, a slow-burning narrative adventure, just build something that you love!
Requirements
Core Features
A playable prototype that showcases the core game loop


Any genre or style is allowed (web, mobile, console, or desktop)


Include UI/UX polish. Menus, controls, and player feedback are consistent with the game’s theme.


Single-player or local multiplayer (please don’t worry about networking for multiple devices!)


Key Focus Areas
Gameplay First: Prioritize the user’s experience. This does not have to be a technologically advanced game, just something you love.


Visual Identity: Coherent and intentional
This means that menus, game themes and any other styling are consistent throughout the game.


Fun Factor: The judges are looking for something they could see themselves playing


Replayability or Narrative Depth: Choose your focus! Once again, build something you love.
